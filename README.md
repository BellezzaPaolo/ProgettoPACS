# ProgettoPACS
This repository aims to integrate the ParaFlowS method into the library [deepXDE](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde). It will be done in C++ using pybind11 to bind python and C++ code. A simple python implementation is contained into the python_src folder. For both implementation refer to their README.md.

## C++ implementation

See [src/README.md](src/README.md) for:
- build/run instructions (LibTorch + embedded Python)
- project structure
- CSV outputs and Doxygen generation

## python implementation

See [python_src/README.md](python_src/README.md) for:
- build/run instructions
- project installation
- description of the files
